<b>Multi-apartment <a href="https://bas-ip.com/">IP Intercom</a></b>

IP intercoms are a fairly new branch in intercom, which can provide not only the basic tasks of accepting a call from the panel and opening the lock, but also many new functions that will greatly simplify your life. Such devices transmit data in digital form using a local network or the Internet, which significantly improves the quality and speeds up their work.
Entrance IP intercoms are much more expensive than digital or coordinate ones. They are widely used in large business centers and modern residential complexes. The capabilities of these intercoms exceed the capabilities of analog ones at times. They are able not only to create a connection between the front door and the apartment, but also to call the phone in your absence. In addition, IP intercoms are used to view video surveillance, the state of the fire alarm on the territory. They can send mass messages, display news information and much more.
<i>Pros of IP intercoms:</i>
+ Security of communication;
+ View video cameras without additional devices;
+ Call forwarding to mobile;
+ Additional functions;

What are IP intercom systems?
IP intercom systems operate on the basis of the TCP / IP protocol stack, which means that IP-Intercoms can operate on the basis of an existing local network at home, office center or cottage town, without requiring additional cabling.

The following advantages of such a system can be distinguished:
1. Flexibility to upgrade and expand.
2. Multifunctionality of monitors: video intercom between subscribers, support for photo frame mode, touch screen, answering machine, presence of a multimedia player, the ability to view IP cameras and many other features.
3. The interactive system "Information and Services" is a universal platform for creating information directories of residential complexes (or other objects), with the help of which the user can get any useful information, for example, about the nearest post office or hospital, as well as call a plumber, electrician or other utilities.
4. The ability to send photos and messages, both centrally and individually with special software.
5. Connection of an unlimited number of devices in the system (from 1 to 100,000 subscribers)
6. Ability to control "Home Automation" from a monitor or using an application on iOS or Android.
7. Management Software is a utility that allows you to track the statuses of all outdoor panels, internal monitors and concierge monitors in the system, generate reports and keep statistics, etc.
8. Integration of outdoor panels with third-party ACS. The <a href="https://bas-ip.com/catalog/panels/">outdoor panels</a></b> of IP intercoms, as a rule, have support for the Wiegand-26 interface, which allows you to integrate outdoor panels into third-party ACS and connect various devices to the panels.
9. Ability to record video from panels to NVR / DVR. The calling panels of IP intercoms give an RTSP stream in D1 resolution, which allows you to record everything that happens near the door station on the NVR / DVR, without interfering with its main functionality.
10. Support for SIP protocol. If there is an additional SIP server, the user will be able to receive video calls from outdoor panels remotely to smartphones and PCs, open the lock, make video calls to smartphones and PCs to internal monitors and outdoor panels, make group calls, call forwarding and much more.
